# :tennis: Courtennis
Welcome to Courtennis, an online e-commerece tennis store.
The store was implemented using Node.js as backend, React js as Frontend and a MongoDB Atlas Collection as a DB.
The store has multiple flows implemented, register and login to the store, you can browse between the store products, contact us and give us your review on the store, read about us, add products to the cart, and checkout and buy from the store.
We also have an admin tab, designated for seeing the users in the store.
